## As a hobby,  I write, play and record music.

##### Coolest Project:

Successfully completed and delivered a platform to digitize a guitar signal and perform filtering before executing frequency & time domain analysis to track a current performance against prerecorded performance.

*   Implemented the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm in C++ and Python to autonomously activate or adjust guitar effect at multiple pre-designated section of performance.

Bryan Guner is a senior studying Electrical Engineering at The College of New Jersey. He is team leader as well as being tasked with developing a protocol for digital signal processing of the guitar signal in order to create a time-sequential record of the frequency content of the guitar signal, and a comparison between pre recorded songs and live performances. Upon graduation Bryan intends to work in industry hopefully in addition to pursuing a masters degree. Hobbies include but are not limited to: guitar, music, hockey, physics, philosophy, art, and spending time with good friends.
